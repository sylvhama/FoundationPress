# FoundationPress 5

This is a WordPress starter theme based on Foundation 5 by Zurb. The purpose of FoundationPress, is to act as a small and handy toolbox that contains the essentials needed to build any design. FoundationPress is meant to be a starting point, not the final product. If you're looking for an all-in-one theme with built-in shortcodes, plugins, fancypancy portfolio templates or whatnot, I'm afraid you have to look elsewhere.

This is a fork of the Foundation-5 branch of https://github.com/olefredrik/FoundationPress

## What did I change?

  * CoffeeScript support;
  * Different structure (like vendors.js);
  * BEM (mixin + examples);
  * Angular added to Bower.json + examples created;
  * HTML minification (in /parts);
  * Image minification;  
  * No more Font Awesome, I prefer IcoMoon (not included by default) 
  * X-UA-Compatible metatag added;
  * favicon metatags have been removed, I prefer using http://realfavicongenerator.net/extensions/wordpress/ ;
  * Enqueue Google fonts function added.
